# SDL2 VGA Terminal 

It is an emulation of the VGA terminal using SDL2.

the VGA fonts are related to a `vgabios` project.

At the moment support only mode 3.

It should be on 16 colors in the classic way, but can support more thanks to SDL2.

It is just a matter of fonts and a terminal grid for displaying texts.
